Explore and analyze the codebase in the current working directory. Create a concise architecture document (max 300 lines).

IMPORTANT:
- Use your tools to explore the codebase (Glob, Read, Grep)
- Be extremely concise. Focus only on what's essential. Skip obvious details, boilerplate, and verbose explanations.

Focus on:
- High-level system structure and components
- Key directories and their purposes
- Main architectural patterns used
- Technology stack
- Data flow and component relationships
- Important entry points and main paths through code

Keep it SHORT and focused on the big picture. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs where possible. Skip introductory text and get straight to the facts.

Format as markdown with clear sections.
