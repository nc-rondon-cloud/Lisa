Explore and analyze the codebase in the current working directory. Extract business rules and domain logic (max 300 lines).

IMPORTANT:
- Use your tools to explore the codebase (Glob, Read, Grep)
- Be extremely concise. Focus only on what's essential. Skip verbose explanations and implementation details.

Focus on:
- Core business logic and rules
- Domain models and their constraints
- Validation rules
- Business workflows and processes
- Key algorithms and calculations
- Important constants and configuration
- Business-specific terminology

Keep it SHORT and focused on the domain logic. Use bullet points and lists instead of long paragraphs. Skip introductory text and get straight to the rules.

Format as markdown with clear sections.
