Explore and analyze the codebase in the current working directory. Create general context documentation (max 300 lines).

IMPORTANT:
- Use your tools to explore the codebase (Glob, Read, Grep)
- Be extremely concise. Focus only on what's essential. Skip verbose descriptions and obvious information.

Focus on:
- Project overview and purpose
- Key features and capabilities
- Development setup and requirements
- Testing approach
- Deployment information
- Common development tasks
- Important notes and gotchas
- External dependencies and integrations

Keep it SHORT and practical. Use bullet points and lists instead of paragraphs. Skip introductory text and get straight to actionable information.

Format as markdown with clear sections.
